	<description>Minor expansion to mining on rimworld.	Vanilla metals now have to be smelted from ores before they can be used.
	Mines are added. They spawn infestations like vanilla drills. 
	After depletion they leave "abadoned mine" for 45 days (configurable), after that time, mine can be rebilt. Mine can't be destroyed nor deconstructed to prevent cheesing.
	Mod also adds "adobe bricks". You can craft them at "brick spot" (production tab). After that you can build "drying racks" from raw bricks and wood. In about ~3 ingame days bricks will be ready to use. That addtion was made to ensure that player has means to make first smelting furnace.
	
	I have attached link to my google form about this mod. It wil help me enhance and shape my mod for it's users ( it means YOU!), so consider filling it.
	Enjoy!
